Once in the foyer, it is eerily quiet, for the scene of a murder. There is a small side table by the door with a large black telephone on it, and a pair of folded round eyeglasses, resting on a silver drinks tray. Your phone number is scrawled on the notepad by the phone - presumably written by the person who phoned you here. To the right, an open door leads to a brightly lit dining room. [[You enter the dining room.]]

No one is around.
Well, there is somebody. A dead body. Next to the remains of what looks like a delicious soup, are the bodily remains of a finely dressed gentleman with glasses. In addition to a rather smart-looking dinner jacket, he is also sporting what looks like several stab wounds to the chest.
You know that the victim is also owner of the mansion, multimillionaire and host of the dinner party. He has met his untimely death at the hands of one of someone in the mansion, no doubt. You peer back down at the body.
You can either [[take his nice looking silver pocket watch]] or [[examine the stab wounds]].

This body is pretty fresh, actually, which is a relief. The stab wounds look to have been made by a long, thin (and obviously sharp) object, which is nowhere to be found in the dining room itself. You wonder about what led to this fellow&#39;s demise... but the task at hand is to find the killer, not unpack his life history. You know that some of the dinner guests are congregated in the next room over, a small sitting room. You can either [[go into the sitting room]], [[empty out his pockets]] or [[head back to the foyer]].

Too afraid to go on, you don&#39;t solve the murder, and you get the award for Biggest Chicken. Whistling a tune, you head to the nearest tavern while assuming that everyone in the mansion will meet some horrible fate without you.

You can either keep going and [[enter the first bedroom]] or [[examine the stairs]] more.

They all appear to be accounted for - one guest in the room for each place at the dinner table. They mill about like lost cows in a paddock, but one breaks away and heads towards you. It is an older woman with kind eyes. You [[speak to the woman]].

There is a partially burned piece of paper in the fireplace - the remains of a letter. It is mostly burned, but you can see one word - that reads &quot;Annabelle&quot;.
You pocket the letter discreetly and exit the sitting room, leaving the guests milling about in a fitful state. You [[head for the stairs]].

The woman has blazing red hair and is wearing a beautiful necklace with a shiny pendant on it in the shape of an &quot;A&quot;.
You turn to address the woman but she is already deep in conversation with another guest. You leave the room, and [[head for the stairs]].

She has a small pink hat on, with fine netting pinned to her grey bun. She speaks in a very soft voice and talks about the deceased, but sadly none of it is useful. However, just as she is about to shuffle away, she presses something small into your palm. It is a [[folded up piece of paper]].

story_id = 10</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="enter the first bedroom" tags="" position="1200,724.5" size="100,100">The room is lavishly decorated in pink tones and delicate lace.

Bonza! You find a beautiful necklace, with a pendant in the shape of an &quot;A&quot;. There is also a heavy silver hairbrush. On the handle is engraved the name &quot;Annabelle&quot;. You [[keep looking around the room]] or [[head into the hallway]].

You acknowledge that at the moment you are just arbitrarily moving around the mansion and happening upon simplistic clues, but you push that thought aside as you open the drawer to the bedside table.
Inside is a photograph, of a young red-haired woman standing next to a tall older gentleman with a smart-looking dinner jacket on. He has his hand on her shoulder, and she is wearing monogrammed riding clothes, and no jewellery. You pocket the photograph and [[keep looking around]] or [[head into the hallway]].

You stay up here and [[investigate the crash]] or [[run downstairs]].

You do.
A small, older lady with a pink hat lies in the center of the ballroom. There is a pool of blood around her head like a halo, and her small fists are clenched shut.
You look around accusingly. Another murder, right under your nose!
Some of the guests are all huddled in a group by the grand piano, eyes wide with fright.
You either [[examine the old lady]] or [[look around the room for clues]].

story_id = 29</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="go into the bathroom" tags="" position="1368,1199.5" size="100,100">Really? Okay then. You pursue the figure into the ensuite bathroom... or rather, you try to. Before you know quite what is happening, white gloved hands fasten around your neck and everything is fading... fading... and black.

story_id = 27</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="examine the old lady" tags="" position="1498,1050.5" size="100,100">You learn closer to the poor old love. She has a kind face. In one fist is clutched a delicate lace handkerchief. In the other, a crumpled up piece of paper. You gently pry it from her grasp - it is what looks like a formal resignation letter, and it is signed with the name &quot;John&quot;. It is addressed to the now deceased owner of the house. You decide to [[look around the room for clues]].

story_id = 30</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="look around the room for clues" tags="" position="1648,1050.5" size="100,100">It&#39;s not long before you stumble upon the wooden panel in the wall, cracked open slightly. You gently pry it back, to reveal the gaping hole of a secret passageway hidden behind it. But where does it lead? Apprehensive, you aren&#39;t sure whether to head into the dark unknown or backtrack and investigate another area of the house for this audacious murderer. You look behind you, but the guests have all gone back to the sitting room. Do you [[head into the secret passage]] or [[look in the conservatory]]?

story_id = 31</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="head into the secret passage" tags="" position="1573,1200.5" size="100,100">You head into the secret passage and gently close the panel behind you. Luckily, you have a small torch with you, which you light as you make your way forward. Outside, the storm is still howling. You begin to turn the events over in your mind, and just as you are coming to a realisation, you reach a small alcove area in the tunnel - someone&#39;s secret hideout. Here there is a small chair and table with a lamp on it - you use some matches to light the lamp so you can see better. On the table is a pair of folded round eyeglasses, a small moustache comb and a pair of bloodstained white gloves. The walls of the alcove are plastered with bits of paper - a map of the house, what looks to be a work roster with the name &quot;J. Atkins&quot; at the top, and several photographs of a red-haired woman.
Do you [[head back to the entrance]] to call the police, or [[keep going down the tunnel]]?

story_id = 34</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="look in the conservatory" tags="" position="1724,1200.5" size="100,100">You enter the conservatory with apprehension, but there is nothing but a dark, glass-walled room - empty. You decide to take a look around anyway.
It&#39;s not long before you find it. A long, thin letter opener, hidden in a pot plant. As the rain lashes the roof of the conservatory, you reach down and grasp the handle. You are just examining the engraved initials (&quot;J.A&quot;) when someone clears their throat behind you. You whip around and are confronted with a tall man in round glasses, a neat moustache, and a murderous glint in his eye. Your hand tightens around the letter opener as your instincts kick in.
You quickly lash out with the letter opener, slashing his cheek and splashing blood on his butler&#39;s uniform. While he is stunned, you push him aside and run for the door. Once in the hallway, you block the door from the outside so he can&#39;t get out and [[head back to the entrance]] to call the police.

story_id = 32</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="head back to the entrance" tags="" position="1498,1350.5" size="100,100">You quickly rush back to the entrance of the mansion and snatch up the black telephone, the murderer&#39;s name on the tip of your tongue.

[[It was the red-haired woman]]
[[Pink hat lady did it]]
[[The butler did it]]

Quick on your feet, you spin around, face to face with John Atkins - the butler, Annabelle&#39;s lover, and two-time murderer. Why did he invite you here if it was his intention to murder others, and maybe you too?
You barely have time to think about this though - you conk him on the head with the heavy telephone headset, breaking his eyeglasses. He topples over onto the foyer floor with a thud. The remaining guests run out from the sitting room where they have been enjoying port and brandy and trying to stay alive, and applaud your fine detective skills and extraordinary luck in solving this mystery.

You spin around frantically. As you do, you notice something in the corner... it looks like... but it can&#39;t be?
It&#39;s a dead body, but it isn&#39;t a nice fresh one. This one is old, in both senses of the word. The fellow has thinning grey hair and portly middle. He is wearing a butler&#39;s uniform.
